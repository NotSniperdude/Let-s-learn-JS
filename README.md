# Let-s-learn-JS

Welcome to Let's learn JS! It's a repository with about every JavaScript concept. It is very useful for those who are barely starting JavaScript, or those who need a refresher or just to learn something new!

idk.js (best filename) will include all of the JS code. It is hooked up to an index.html file.

You are free to use this file.
